# Human work items — RetroMultiCiv

Things only a human (Kjell / friends) can decide or verify. The old,
cluttered version is in `archive/human-workitems.md`. This is a clean
slate — done items are dropped, not struck through.

Convention: `[ ]` open, `[x]` done. Agent/coder tasks live in
`./agent-workitems.md`. An HTML companion is `human-workitems.html`
(regenerated from this file).

_Last synced: 2026-07-22 late night (marker-0088 = candidate, 20
consecutive consistent; three markers tagged today — the sail-era, the
space war-hold, and real wonder effects; redeploy + box commands + a
fresh helper session are the open items)._

---

## DECIDE / DO (needs you)

_Catch-up: `reports/marker-0086.md` (the current candidate);
`reports/away-window-2-brief.md` covers the earlier 0077-0081 arc._

- [ ] **Redeploy from marker-0090** (`8ff258d`, both gates banked):
  everything through 0089 PLUS the archetype AI (civs build the
  wonders their personality says — non-builder wonders 0→20 in the
  judge sweep) and the helper's complete 30-item client window (A58
  pedia, the XV UX set, mobile slice, off-turn orders over server,
  endscreen-name fix). WITH the one-time box unit edit: `--max-turns
  700` (+ optional `--bug-reports` + ReadWritePaths). Hard refresh
  after.

- [ ] **Two session nudges needed** (your direct ask, kept current):
  1. **HARDENING** — idle 8h+, one queued item (XV §13 server-save
     404). Nudge: _git pull origin dev_night, read mail #2216 +
     #2224, take your queue item; when idle run `python3
     tools/agent-mail.py flag wait --as hardening`._
  2. **HELPER (fresh session)** — its 30-item window closed clean and
     it scoped #33 A49-playwright + #34 endgame-moments explicitly
     for a FRESH session (context boundary). Start one when
     convenient; it self-resumes from its memory + queue. These are
     the last two axis-6 items.

- [ ] **Optional ally relay** (no reply needed): a full shareable
  status note is ready at `specs/ally-status-update-2026-07-23.md` —
  their 22-wonder mapping shipped + measured (non-builder wonders
  0→20), the affinity-flag grounding, the advisor copy live, and the
  witness-7 launch measurement running. Forward whenever convenient;
  nothing is pending from them.

- [ ] **One-time box commands for the public index** (DNS record is in
  and propagated by now): append the `servers.` nginx server block
  (from `cloud-init.yaml` ~lines 92–108), extend the cert —
  `sudo certbot --nginx -d multiciv.kjell.today -d
  servers.multiciv.kjell.today` — then reload nginx and curl-check
  `https://servers.multiciv.kjell.today/servers`. Rides the next
  ssh-deploy naturally via cloud-init on a rebuild, but the LIVE box
  needs the manual step once. Until this runs, the baked Find-game
  default shows "master index unreachable" (harmless).

- [ ] **Studio session + runG.txt** (Roblox Studded round-2 review) —
  now the ONLY gate on the Roblox axis: **Tier-3 certification
  re-audit PASSED** (29 gates green; verdict artifact
  `roblox/acceptance/tier3-cert.md` on the gaming PC is your review
  checklist). R6 seats/lobby build is queued behind it agent-side. ·
  **terrain desaturation check** — carried. Nothing is pending with
  the designer ally.

_Recently ruled (2026-07-22):_ **SPACE FORK = (b)+(c) staged** — the
measure-first King sweep proved King space-capable (one civ reached
100% tech closure) but war-abandoned; ruling = war-hold slice (a
near-complete space drive holds through ordinary war) + the
endemic-war/unit-bloat fix, with a King re-sweep as the acceptance
after each. Earlier same day: scope = maximal cut; XV §7 settler-modal
= Civ2-shape refuse; DNS = `servers.multiciv.kjell.today` (record
added — thank you). _Recently landed:_ markers 0087 + 0088
same-evening (20 consecutive since 0069) — presence-2 (the sail-era:
judge-sweep PASS, overseas settlement ~2x), the space war-hold (9/9
committed drives now survive war; launches await the endemic-war fix,
staged per your ruling), the behavior-hash discriminator (already
classifying re-records mechanically), A7 (8 of 9 wonder effects live,
every shape wiki-dump-verified), and pyramids as the authentic Civ1
government wonder (landed, gates in flight). Roblox: Tier-3 CERTIFIED
+ R6 agent-complete + a clean runH autoplay — your Studded round-2 is
the only axis-4 gate.

---

## PLAYTEST (high value right now)

- [ ] **Fresh LAN session on marker-0069+** — player-facing systems that
  no human has played: goody huts, caravan trade routes, unit upgrades,
  the debug panel (🐞), the spaceship screen, and the late-game save
  loading. A session field-tests them AND (with Shift+D recordings) seeds
  **benchmark corpus #2** (the primary AI metric). Try **Marathon mode**
  (the "play until victory" checkbox) if you want to see the late game.

- [x] **Mobile T0 — CLOSED.** You confirmed nav (direct + d-pad), zoom,
  screensaver-resume, and regency; the helper then verified select / move /
  production on touch (Pixel-5) and **fixed a real blocker** — the city
  panel didn't scroll at phone height, so most of the buildable catalog was
  unreachable (mobile production was broken). Fixed + regression-tested.
  Worth a confirming pass on your own phone, but no longer an open question.

- [ ] **Mobile seated-start RE-TEST (X.6 follow-up).** The hang you saw
  (phone joined lobby + chatted, but game START showed nothing; spectator
  worked) did NOT reproduce on an active connection — it's the mobile
  socket-drop class, and the fixes for it (heartbeat + lobby seat-grace +
  wake-reconnect, Part A+B+C) shipped AFTER your ~00:00 playtest. Please
  re-test on your phone. If it STILL hangs at start, add `&mlog=1` (the
  overlay now survives the lobby→game reload on its own) and the on-screen
  log will capture exactly where — send me that. One known residual to
  watch: if the phone is fully asleep at the *instant* of Start (past the
  ~45s reclaim), it should land on the "you missed the start" truth screen,
  NOT a blank — flag if it's blank.

- [ ] **Roblox acceptance (carried):** save `roblox/acceptance/runD.txt`
  and retest the deck-resident avatar flow.

## FYI — recently shipped / resolved (no action)

- **The AI settles overseas** (naval presence-1, marker-0086): an
  island-saturated coastal city now builds its own first carrier, sea
  units explore unexplored ocean, and trireme-class hulls route
  coastal-only (the authentic open-sea risk honored — sail-era ships
  cross open ocean). Overseas cities emerge on archipelago seeds where
  the baseline was 0/5; a new archipelago witness guards it in the
  cross-language twins gate.
- **The advisor speaks the ally's words**: all 15 onboarding hint cards
  now carry the designer ally's copy verbatim, plus 4 new pedia
  concepts (exploration / diplomacy / pollution / victory —
  title-neutral per the branding amendment).
- **Master index is PUBLIC**: `servers.multiciv.kjell.today` is the
  baked Find-game default (out-of-the-box server discovery; `?master=off`
  opts out), with the security re-assessment recorded in docs/16 §6 and
  the operator "list your server" section in how-to-host. Only the
  one-time box step above remains.
- **Entry default + tab-loss resume**: bare URLs start a LOCAL client
  game (server only for Host LAN / Join LAN / Find game); local games
  autosave to browser storage every turn, the setup screen offers
  Resume, and a 💾 icon sits left of the 📖.
- **Hosting Q&A answered** (your sizing/firewall questions): **ports** — game
  server `8123` (HTTP + WebSocket on the *same* port), master index `8200`
  (both `--port`-configurable); firewall = open 22/80/443 behind nginx (keep
  8123/8200 localhost), or 22/8123/8200 direct. **Sizing — MEASURED
  (2026-07-22, #2228)**: RAM is NOT the driver — ~245 MB fixed cost, then only
  ~1 MB live heap (~2.2 MB RSS conservative) per concurrent mid-game game, so
  even 2 GB fits ~800 games by RSS. The real ceilings are the admission caps
  (`--max-games`, default 50; maxConns 200) and CPU (the synchronous engine
  turn) — size by those, not RAM; 40 GB SSD ample; the master index adds only
  ~100 MB.
- **Coordination tooling** (internal, your requests): the agent system now has a
  `coordinator` role alias, a live **status board** (waiting/working/blocked),
  and per-lane **work stacks** — so no lane sits idle waiting for direction and
  blocked lanes raise their hand. Keeps v1 delivery moving without me
  hand-routing every task.
- **Crash resilience + ws-timeout SHIPPED** (markers 0066/0067, your requests):
  crashdumps + OOM watchdog + self-restart loop, and a busy-tolerant heartbeat
  that stops false connection-reaps during an event-loop block. Together they
  cover the turn-2623 drop (crash vs block). See `specs/server-crash-resilience.md`.
- **Turn-2623 OOM root-caused** (your memory question) — traced to the server's
  unbounded recording `log` (`server/game.js`): every human/regent command is
  logged and never trimmed, so a long regency game grows ~110–420 MB by t2623,
  which with the large late-game state can OOM. The state itself doesn't leak.
  Fix routed to hardening (stream per-command entries to disk, keep only the
  tiny round-hashes in RAM); the OOM watchdog will confirm + auto-recover
  meanwhile. Recorded in `specs/server-crash-resilience.md`.
- **Designer-ally cover note ANSWERED** — the ally delivered all of it: the
  **68 original tech-discovery blurbs** (the empty discovery-card slots on
  browser + Roblox), the **Movement + Regency + Recordings** pedia concepts,
  ratified the **Oracle ×4** as Civ1-authentic (with a legibility ask), and
  chose **The Colossus** as Caesar's favorite wonder (Great Wall stays
  Frederick's). Now being wired in: client copy → helper (#1711),
  Caesar→Colossus + a `railroad` name fix → engine lane (#1712). Full copy
  captured in `specs/ally-deliverables-2026-07-18.md`. Also ratified the
  provenance-label table and the "personality supplies a preference; the
  world supplies permission" aggression principle.
- **World-look = ENHANCED** (your Roblox run-F item 4): resolves the
  standing world-look pick → enhanced is the default (retro stays a
  toggle). This UNBLOCKS the roblox lane's CP1 art pass. Your run-F
  feedback is triaged in `specs/roblox-runF-triage-2026-07-19.md` — most
  items are Roblox-only (roblox-helper owns them); the cross-platform ones
  (unit/building blurbs, city-name lists, era-based city looks) are routed.
- **Tech tree + beeline + glyphs SHIPPED** (XII.6, your request): a
  graphical 🌳 tech-tree (era columns, prerequisite edges, ✓/○/· states) in
  addition to the list, a **beeline** (click a distant tech → it auto-researches
  the path), and a procedural **icon per tech**. All golden-neutral client.
  The ally's 33 motif concepts are implemented and glyphs now show on all
  three surfaces (tree, discovery card, research readout) — **XII.6 is
  COMPLETE end-to-end.** (One glyph, horseback-riding, is flagged as an
  optional later tighten.)
- **The 68 tech-discovery blurbs SHIPPED** (ally-authored): the empty
  discovery-card slots are filled on browser AND Roblox (parity self-test
  green). Plus the Movement/Regency/Recordings pedia concepts and the
  Oracle ×4 legibility (the happiness breakdown now reads `Temple +4`).
- **A59 leader personality SHIPPED** (marker-0061): every civ gets a
  leader + a 4-axis personality (aggression/science/growth/defense) — the
  data foundation the diplomacy AI reads. Golden-neutral in behaviour.
- **Late-game save loading SHIPPED** (marker-0062): load a hosted-game
  save in the client, camera recenters on load, dead human seats collapse
  to AI. Driven red-first by your real turn-1617 save.
- **D3 AI diplomacy — SHIPPED** (marker-0064, `87cfe3b`): the AI negotiates
  (war/peace, met-state + first contact) at the swept `peaceAcceptThreshold=30`
  — where your **mix-conditional elimination** and the **space-launch
  coalition** land. Two-phase close: byte-shaped JS==Luau → sim-runner sweep →
  one re-record; Gate-B (Luau full parity) + full suite green, bugfixer-verified.
  D3 opens the phase-6 diplomacy line (D4–D6 follow, docs/14).
- **City-look-by-era SHIPPED** (your Roblox run-F item 8): city visuals now
  vary by ERA band (ancient thatch → classical stone+keep → industrial
  brick+smokestacks → modern/space glass+dome) composing with the size
  tiers, per the ally's editorial verdict (silhouette not recolor; owner
  color on the base ring). Render-only, fog-honest. Roblox uses the same
  shared band contract for its item-8 parity.
- **Server hardening COMPLETE + hardened further**: docs/17 plan + the v1
  safe-to-expose posture, plus added limits.js unit coverage and an
  X-Frame-Options anti-clickjacking header. Safe on a small public VM with
  the docs/16 §4 operator checklist.
- **Mobile network fix COMPLETE** (heartbeat + lobby seat-grace + client
  wake-reconnect): a briefly screen-locked phone reconnects and keeps its
  LAN seat. This was the "phone stranded in the lobby" failure.
- **N9b wonder-drive SHIPPED + validated** (marker-0059): builder capitals
  commit to wonders (minority, no monopoly). The launch half of ending-#4.

## Parked / future (on record, mostly no input needed)

- **XII.5 — AI/regency late-game victory drive** (your long-game feedback):
  the regent going "nothing to do" in the end-game is captured — a
  personality-selected drive (aggressive→conquest with weakest/closest
  targeting; science/builder→space) so a late-game seat never idles.
  Specced (specs/xii5-ai-victory-drive.md), queued after D3; a baseline
  measurement is running. No input needed unless you want the regent to
  "win by any means" instead of by its civ's personality.
- **XII.2 — Future Tech N** (your refinement): a repeatable score sink once
  the tree is exhausted, Civ1-authentic. Specced, queued after D3.
- **Server crash resilience — being built** (your request): crashes now
  get recorded to a `crashdumps/` file + stderr (stack + memory + per-game
  turn/unit counts), so next time you'll know if it was the node process
  and whether it was OOM. Plus an OOM memory-watchdog that autosaves +
  exits gracefully before V8's fatal OOM, and a `run.sh`/`run.ps1` restart
  loop that auto-restarts on crash (games resume from per-command autosave).
  This ALSO disambiguates the turn-2623 mystery: an OOM leaves an oom-dump;
  the event-loop-block (ws-timeout, below) leaves the process alive with no
  dump. Routed to the server-robustness lane (#1752, spec written).
- **Late-game ws-timeout (turn 2623) — being triaged:** your very-long
  hosted game dropped the socket. Diagnosed as SERVER-side (the client was
  reconnecting correctly; the server wasn't completing the handshake) — at
  that extreme scale a single AI turn-chain blocks the server's event loop
  past the heartbeat window. Routed to the server-robustness lane (#1732);
  a busy-tolerant heartbeat + yielding within the AI chain are the fixes.
  Beyond the validated scale (turn-1617), so it's a real hosting-robustness
  item, not a regression. If you can, note whether the `node` process was
  still alive or had exited when it happened.
- **Roblox run-F — 10/11 committed** (`ba9ad3f`): the roblox-helper's batch
  landed (panels, tile improvements, debug/DataStore config, city-name
  render fix, ff-diorama, pedia movement/regency, selftest gates 12–14);
  city-look-by-era (item 8) SHIPPED on the browser (see FYI), the shared
  contract is ready for the Roblox port; city-name lists get expanded (in
  the queued data window); the unit/building blurbs await your ally forward
  (Decide/Do). No input needed beyond that forward.
- **Phase-6 diplomacy D4–D6:** D1 shipped, D3 in build; D4 (tribute + tech
  terms), D5 (reputation + senate), D6 (embassies) follow. Pre-ruled
  defaults on record (docs/14) — no input needed until they land.
- **Global "find a game" + internet hosting** (A51 master-index): the
  LAN-local find-a-game works; the public master index is gated on you
  scheduling DNS / a VM (docs/12).
- **16+ civ roster:** cap ships at 14 (A38); going past it is a deliberate
  future scope decision.
- **Live strategic overlay** (🧠 per-AI stance/mode panel): SHIPPED,
  debug/spectator-gated — makes the heterogeneous-AI work visible during a
  spectate.
